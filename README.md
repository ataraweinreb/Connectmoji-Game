# Connectmoji Game 
> An interactive 2-player (computer vs human player) "connection" game, implementated in JavaScript.

* The game is played on a vertical grid of cells (imagine a board stood on its side).
* Players take alternate turns dropping a piece in a column.
* The piece dropped will occupy the lowest unoccupied cell of the grid.
* When a player drops a piece that results in an uninterrupted vertical, horizontal or diagonal line of adjacent identical pieces of an agreed upon length, that player wins!
